# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Overview

This project utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and others to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various health-related features. The machine learning model is trained on a dataset containing relevant health parameters, and the prediction is made using supervised learning techniques.

## Project Structure

- `heart_disease_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for data analysis, preprocessing, and model training.
- `dataset.csv`: CSV file containing the dataset with health parameters and corresponding labels.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- `scikit-learn`: Machine learning library for building predictive models.
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: Data visualization libraries.
- `numpy`: Numerical computing library.

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn numpy
```

## Running the Project
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook heart_disease_prediction.ipynb in a Jupyter environment.
Make sure to have the dataset.csv file in the same directory as the notebook.
Follow the notebook steps for data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Model Evaluation
The project includes evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the performance of the heart disease prediction model.

## Customization
Modify the dataset or experiment with different machine learning algorithms for model training.
Explore additional features or optimizations to enhance prediction accuracy.
